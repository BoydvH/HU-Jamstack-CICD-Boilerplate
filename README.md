# HU Guest lecture Jamstack & CICD Boilerplate
Boilerplate code for a guest lecture at the HU regarding Jamstack and CICD on the 28th of May, 2020.

Let people become familiar with the concept of Jamstack and CICD in 4 steps:
1. Deploying a static site to Netlify from a git repository
2. Templates & generating a static site from them with Eleventy
3. Sourcing Data from the Contentful API & webhooking this together
4. Making the product more robust with some fancy CICD plugins
